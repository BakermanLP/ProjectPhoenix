## Applied Energistics
* Author: AlgorithmX2
* License: Yes, Ive officially opened up all my restrictions on this. If someone asks you if you have permission, send them here, or if you really insist send me a PM on http://www.minecraftforum.net.

All I really ask is that you make sure that you tell people that my mod is included. Something like "Applied Energistics by AlgorithmX2" with a link to this wiki would work nicely.

## AsieLib, Computronics
* Author: Asie
* License: You may include the mod in your modpack if, and only if, you follow the following terms:
Credit for the author is given somewhere in a visible place on a website (a “credits” link on forums or the website is probably enough; if the pack has no website, information in the launcher or included ZIP file or installer is enough; if the pack has no installer or ZIP file, what?),
Youre not a dick about usage of the mod.

## Buildcraft
* Author: SpaceToad
* License: As of November 1st, 2011, the answer is YES. But that comes with constraints and restrictions. BuildCraft is released through an Open-Source license, the Minecraft Mod Public License. It does allow redistribution of the mod in its various forms (sources, binaries) in certain cases. Make sure that you do understand the license before distributing a mod including BuildCraft!

The main restriction is that sources must be accessible. If you are only redistributing the unmodified binaries, or class files, adding a link to http://www.mod-buildcraft.com is enough – sources can be retrieved from there. Otherwise, make sure that you clearly understand the implications, and asks questions in the forum if needed.

You must explicitely state, on the website, thread, blog or other public location (further referred to as 'location'), the presence of IC² in your modpack in a readable and user-understandable manner and English language (usage of multiple languages, including at least one English translation, is permitted).
Either the download or the location must contain some sort of 'Credit's, listing up the 'IC² Dev Team' (this term is considered sufficient, it is not necessary to label the members of the Dev Team by name) as creator of IC².
A link to http://www.industrial-craft.net/ or http://forum.industrial-craft.net/ must be present, user-visible, at the location of publication.
You may not gain any direct revenue associated with the download of any data containing the redistributed IC² files. This literally applies to AdFly, but as well to other advertisment services, including those services basing revenue of website traffic.

You may contact me (aka Alblaka), head of the IC² Dev Team, to negotiate conditions different from those specified above, if the necessarity arises.
